# The Pursuer

The Pursuer at the Forest of Fallen Giants is an optional boss. However, this
boss is on the shortest path to The Lost Bastille. The other path to The Lost
Bastille would require you to journey to No-man's Wharf and defeat the Flexile
Sentry. The Pursuer is usually easier and quicker to defeat than reaching
No-man's Wharf and fighting the Flexile Sentry.

Rest at the Cardinal Tower bonfire and attune any spells you need for the
upcoming couple of bosses. Use the Soldier Key to unlock the iron door that
leads to the arena of The Pursuer. Throw an Alluring Skull to distract the
nearby Hollow Soldiers to give you plenty of time to open the door. Dash to the
arena of the boss.

The Pursuer is another easy boss to cheese, second only to the Dragonrider at
Heide's Tower of Flame. As you enter the mist, run to the barrels diagonally to
your left. Wait for the boss to perform a charged slashing attack, roll through
the attack, and run to the left-most ballista. Use the ballista to shoot bolts
at The Pursuer. From NG+7 onward, five bolts are enough to kill the boss. Refer
to the video below for the cheese strategy.

If for some reason the cheese does not work for you, fight the boss melee style.
Buff your weapon with lightning if possible. Lock onto the boss and bait the
charging slash attack. As the boss charges at you, dash to your right, strafe
behind the boss, and get in one hit. See the video below for the strategy.

Defeat The Pursuer and interact with the crow nest located at the back of the
boss arena. You would be transported to The Lost Bastille.
