# Armours

Equip any armour pieces that provide decent defense. Prioritize fashion over raw
defense numbers. At NG+7 and beyond, many enemies and most bosses can kill your
character within a few hits. There is little point to being encumbered by a
heavy armour set when a boss can one- or two-shot your character. Regardless of
which armour pieces you equip, ensure your equip load is less than 70%. You
might find the following useful:

-   Any piece of the Havel's Set provides high physical defense.
-   The Warlock Mask is in general the best head piece to equip. It has decent
    physical damage absorption and high resistance against the following damage
    types: dark, magic, petrification, curse, and lightning. The primary reason
    why you should have the Warlock Mask equipped the majority of the time is
    that the head piece allows you to absorb 2.5% extra souls from each defeated
    enemy. You need all the souls you can get to achieve the maximum soul level.
-   The Hollow Skin and Black Witch Veil are useful for one purpose: high curse
    resistance. While equipped, each of these head pieces allows you to safely
    traverse areas that would otherwise build up your curse metre. The Shaded
    Ruins at Shaded Woods is filled with Curse Jars. These are breakable pottery
    that cause your curse bar to fill up if you happen to be near them. Equip
    the Hollow Skin or the Black Witch Veil to safely run through Shaded Ruins.
    Furthermore, equip the Hollow Skin or the Black Witch Veil during the fight
    against Nashandra to prevent your character from hollowing.
-   Jester's Gloves. Like the Tseldora Manchettes, the Jester's Gloves boost
    your souls gain by 10%. In contrast to the Tseldora Manchettes, the Jester's
    Gloves provide better defense overall.
-   Engraved Gauntlets. While equipped, any attack you perform has 5% chance to
    become a critical hit. Works best if you often spam attacks.
-   The following armour pieces can reduce fall damage.

    -   Lion Warrior Helm
    -   Red Lion Warrior Cape
    -   Lion Warrior Cape
    -   Lion Warrior Cuffs
    -   Flying Feline Boots. The best armour piece for reducing fall damage.
    -   Sanctum Knight Leggings
    -   Jester's Tights
    -   Lion Warrior Skirt

-   Each of the following items raises your casting speed. The auxiliary effect
    is especially useful if you make heavy use of spells.

    -   Black Hood
    -   Chaos Hood
    -   Lion Mage Robe
    -   Lion Mage Cuffs
    -   Lion Mage Skirt

-   Each of the Hexer's Hood and Saint's Hood increases the number of casts by
    one for all attuned spells.
-   The Black Witch Hat grants an additional attunement slot.
-   Pharros Mask. The main (and probably only) reason for equipping this head
    piece is to perform the Brightbug glitch. The effects of a Brightbug
    normally last for 120 seconds. The Brightbug glitch extends the duration of
    the effects until your character dies or you warp to a bonfire. The glitch
    works as follows. Equip the Pharros Mask, consume a Brightbug, quit to main
    menu, load your character again, and the glitch should now take effect. You
    can swap the Pharros Mask out for another head gear; the glitch should still
    be in effect.

    The Brightbug glitch is useful for two reasons. First, it allows you to run
    through a difficult area with a buff to your defense and damage output. The
    areas in which the Brightbug glitch would be useful include Iron Keep and
    Shrine of Amana. Second, the Brightbug glitch allows you to conserve your
    limited stock of Brightbugs. Normally, you can purchase 15 Brightbugs from
    Melentia. Brightbug x 2 are found in the base game; these are easy to
    obtain, especially the Brightbug at Aldia's Keep. A number of Brightbugs are
    found in each of the DLCs, but collecting them can be tedious and difficult.
    The Brightbugs found in the base game and purchased from Melentia are
    usually not enough to last an NG cycle, assuming that you pop a Brightbug
    for each boss. Use the Brightbug glitch to help you stock up on Brightbugs
    for the upcoming NG cycles.
