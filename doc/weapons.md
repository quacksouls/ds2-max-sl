# Weapons

You do not need to collect all weapons. However, having a large collection of
these would help you to pick and choose the items that suit your play style.

Choose the melee weapons you are comfortable with to help you defeat all or some
mandatory bosses as quickly as possible. No matter which melee weapons you
choose, you should know when to use which weapons against which enemies and
bosses. Stick to a small number of melee weapons to help you easily remember and
quickly swap to the required weapon. For example, have about three melee weapons
that you will use throughout the challenge run. Move all other weapons to
storage to prevent your inventory from clutter.

For crowd control, you require a long weapon that has a horizontal swing such as
the one-handed R1 of the Greatsword. In 1-on-1 combat situations you might
prefer a weapon having a faster attack animation than the Greatsword, such as
the Red Iron Twinblade. In other cases you might require a weapon having an even
faster attack animation. Any of the rapier class of weapons would do.

Consider equipping a main weapon that you will use the majority of the time
while dashing to various boss arenas. The purpose of this main weapon is to help
you clear enemies as required. Lightning is usually the general-purpose
elemental buff for your main weapon. Also consider infusing your main weapon
with a Boltstone. Any of the ultra greatswords is a good choice as a main weapon
to help you quickly dispatch of enemies.

Limit your use of shields to a minimum and only whenever necessary. You can
certainly sprint to the boss arenas while blocking with a shield. Shields can
also be used to parry various enemies. Any of the Buckler, Target Shield, or
Parrying Dagger is a good choice. Parrying is optional. Do not feel like you
need to know how to parry some, most, or all enemies. Your main weapon should
usually be good enough to get rid of most enemies you need to fight.

You might find the following weapons useful:

-   Curved Dragon Greatsword, Curved Nil Greatsword, Murakumo. The one-handed R1
    can be used for crowd control. Use the two-handed R1 against strong enemies
    and some bosses. The attack and recovery animation is rather slow. Time your
    attack strategically.
-   Any ultra greatswords, such as Black Knight Ultra Greatsword and Greatsword.
    The one-handed R1 is excellent for crowd control. The one-handed R1 can be
    used against NPC invading phantoms because the horizontal swing covers a
    wide trajectory.
-   The Dragonrider Twinblade, Red Iron Twinblade, and Stone Twinblade should be
    wielded two-handed. The two-handed R1 is rather fast and can deal high
    damage when fully upgraded. Ideal for use in 1-on-1 fights.
-   The Espada Ropera, Estoc, and Ice Rapier are excellent for dealing quick
    succession of R1 attacks. Useful against fast and agile enemies as well as
    bosses who are vulnerable to thrust attacks.
-   Any great shield, especially Havel's Greatshield. Use a great shield to
    block an attack, then go in for the punish. The Havel's Greatshield+5 should
    be the only general-purpose shield you need for the challenge run.
-   Blossom Kite Shield. Boosts your Stamina regeneration. The effect stacks
    with Green Blossom and the Chloranthy Ring. The shield has high poison
    resistance, even higher than that of Havel's Greatshield. A poison infusion
    would grant the shield 100% poison resistance, especially useful when you
    run through The Gutter and the Black Gulch.
-   Blue Dagger. While equipped, the weapon boosts the damage of your spells by
    5%, but at the cost of a debuff in fire, lightning, magic, and dark defense.
    Wield this weapon in the left hand while you cast sorcery with a staff in
    the right hand. Do not wield the weapon as you negotiate your path through
    the Shrine of Amana.
