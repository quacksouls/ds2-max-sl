# Consumables

Stock up on the items below.

-   Brightbug. Boosts your damage output by 20% and reduces the damage taken by
    20%. The best item to consume before a boss fight. Consuming a Green Blossom
    or an Elizabeth Mushroom would cancel the effects of Brightbug. If you
    consume a Brightbug and then cast Sacred Oath, the spell would cancel the
    buff from the Brightbug. Melentia initially sells three at the start of an
    NG cycle. Her stock replenishes after the defeat of any of these bosses:

    -   Lost Sinner
    -   Old Iron King
    -   The Rotten
    -   The Duke's Dear Freja
    -   Looking Glass Knight

    When her stock replenishes, the price increases and any previously
    unpurchased Brightbugs would no longer be available until the next NG cycle.
    Purchase all Melentia's stock of Brightbugs at the start of an NG cycle and
    do so as well immediately after the defeat of each of the above bosses.
    Several Brightbugs are scattered throughout the game, but they are in
    general not worth your time or effort to collect. The one exception is the
    Brightbug at Aldia's Keep. Collect it while you run through Aldia's Keep to
    reach the area boss.

    Consider using the Brightbug glitch to extend the duration of the item's
    effects. The effects of a Brightbug normally lasts for 120 seconds. The
    Brightbug glitch allows the effects to last as long as your character is
    alive or you do not warp to a different bonfire. To perform the glitch,
    equip the Pharros Mask, consume a Brightbug, quit to menu, and load your
    character again. The effects of the item now last until your character dies
    or you warp to a different area.

-   Repair Powder. Restores the durability of your equipment. Not really useful
    provided that you rest at various bonfires _en route_ to a boss arena. Have
    some Repair Powder ready in case of an emergency situation. Wellager sells
    an infinite number of Repair Powder.
-   Amber Herb. Restores a small number of spell uses. Vital if you constantly
    use spells. Purchase Amber Herb x 3 from Melentia. Ornifex and Carhillion
    each sells 10 Amber Herbs.
-   Twilight Herb. Restores some number of spells, more than that restored by
    Amber Herb. Handy if you constantly use spells. Carhillion sells Twilight
    Herb x 5. Twilight Herb x 2 are found at Aldia's Keep: one near the
    Foregarden bonfire and the other near the boss arena. Collect the items on
    your way to the area boss.
-   Wilted Dusk Herb. Restores a large number of spell uses, more than that
    restored by Twilight Herb. Indispensable if you use spells to defeat enemies
    on your way to a boss arena. Wellager sells Wilted Dusk Herb x 10. The herb
    can be farmed at Aldia's Keep; see the video below for details.<br/>

    Drangleic Castle. Wellager sells a Divine Blessing for 6,000 souls. One is

-   Lifegem, Radiant Lifegem, and Old Radiant Lifegem. Useful in some
    situations. After relocating to Majula, Melentia would sell an unlimited
    number of Lifegems. Once you have defeated the Lost Sinner, Melentia would
    sell Radiant Lifegem x 10. Wellager sells Old Radiant Lifegem x 10. The
    fully upgraded Estus Flask should be your healing consumable for most cases.
    Have a stock of various Lifegems ready in case you are low on Estus.
-   Elizabeth Mushroom. Heals you for 2,000 HP over the course of 44 seconds.
    Agdayne sells Elizabeth Mushroom x 13. One Elizabeth Mushroom is found in an
    iron chest after defeating the Lost Sinner.
-   Poison Moss. Cures the poison and toxic status ailments, and removes the
    buildup of these effects. Useful during your run through The Gutter, Black
    Gulch, Harvest Valley, and Earthen Peak. At the end of his quest line,
    Gavlan sells an unlimited number of Poison Moss.
-   Monastery Charm. Cures the poison status ailment and restores 850 HP. Useful
    if you happen to run out of Poison Moss. Targray sells Monastery Charm x 3.
    Three can be found near the Tower of Flame bonfire, at the bottom of a
    spiral staircase.
-   Dragon Charm. Cures the poison status ailment and restores 1,500 HP. Useful
    whenever you have depleted your stock of Poison Moss and Monastery Charm.
    Navlaan sells Dragon Charm x 5, but only after you have freed him from his
    enchanted prison.
-   Torch. Increases your torch time by five minutes. One is found at Things
    Betwixt, near the Fire Keeper's Dwelling bonfire. Another is found at lower
    Brightstone Cove Tseldora, behind a door and on your way to the arena of
    Freja. A lit torch is useful in the following cases:

    -   Running through and descending The Gutter. The visibility in this area
        is rather poor.
    -   Lighting the giant lamp x 2 to increase your visibility during the Lost
        Sinner fight.
    -   Running through and descending Brightstone Cove Tseldora to reach the
        arena of Freja. The Parasite Spiders along the way would stay away from,
        and not attack, your character if you have a lit torch.
    -   While fighting Freja. A lit torch in the left hand would ward off the
        Parasite Spiders scattered throughout the boss arena.

-   Flame Butterfly. Lights your torch in case you are far away from a bonfire.
    Ornifex sells an unlimited number of this item for 600 souls each.
-   Small Blue Burr. Boosts your magic defense by 150 points for 90 seconds. The
    effect stacks with the Spell Quartz Ring+3. The only use for this consumable
    is while you navigate through Shrine of Amana. Rosabeth sells an unlimited
    number of this item.
-   Human Effigy. Consume to reverse hollowing. Your character would die a lot
    during the course of the challenge run. A Human Effigy is found on a corpse
    hanging off a ledge, on your way to Drangleic Castle. Magerold sells a Human
    Effigy for 3,000 souls. Grandahl sells three copies of the item for 3,000
    souls apiece. Agdayne sells 13 for 3,000 souls each. Melentia sells five for

    Sentinels. The other to unpetrify Rosabeth, who blocks the passage to Shaded
    Woods. Another two can be used to farm for the following items at Aldia's
    Keeps: Wilted Dusk Herb, Elizabeth Mushroom, Bonfire Ascetic.
