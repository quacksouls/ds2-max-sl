    -   Pharros' Lockstone x 1. Used to unlock the passage to Belfry Luna.

    -   Repair Powder, unlimited quantity
    -   Great Chaos Fireball. Useful against Najka and Mytha.

-   Straid of Olaphis. Your source of powerful spells and the only merchant who
    sells Rouge Water. Purchase Rouge Water x 3 from Straid and consume to
    restore some HP and spell uses. Trade various boss souls with him in return
    for these useful spells:

    -   Sacred Oath, requires Soul of Velstadt
    -   Flame Weapon, requires Old Witch Soul
    -   Crystal Soul Spear, requires Old Paledrake Soul

    Straid also sells the following spells, which are useful in certain
    situations and against various strong enemies and bosses.

    -   Dark Orb
    -   Great Lightning Spear
    -   Sunlight Blade

-   Sweet Shalquoir. The most useful items in her shop are:

    -   Silvercat Ring
    -   Alluring Skull x 10. Unlimited quantity after unlocking the Shrine of
        Winter. The spell Yearn has the same effect and lasts longer.

-   Felkin the Outcast. Useful items include:

    -   Dark Orb
    -   Dark Weapon. Useful against The Last Giant and Giant Lord.
    -   Sunset Staff. The best staff for casting hex and buffing your melee
        weapon with Dark Weapon. Felkin would gift you the staff when you
        exhaust his dialogue while having at least 20 points in each of
        Intelligence and Faith.
    -   Ring of Life Protection x 1. Equip to lose nothing upon death, but does
        not protect against petrification. If your character dies, equip the
        ring so that you do not lose the bloodstain if your character happens to
        also die while trying to retrieve the bloodstain. The ring essentially
        gives you another chance to retrieve the bloodstain.

-   Weaponsmith Ornifex. Useful items include:

    -   Flame Butterfly, unlimited quantity. Use to light your Torch. You
        require a lit Torch throughout some areas in each NG cycle. Use a Flame
        Butterfly in case you are too far away from a bonfire or a lit sconce.
    -   Amber Herb x 10
    -   Green Blossom, unlimited quantity

-   Carhillion of the Fold. The most useful items on sale are as below. You
    should have purchased everything you need from him before commencing the
    challenge run. The journey to him can be rather long and difficult from NG+1
    onward. Many enemies at No-man's Wharf can two- or three-shot you. In
    general, it is not worth your time and effort to access Carhillion's shop,
    but the items are there if the need arises.

    -   Yearn x 1. Unlimited quantity after unlocking the Shrine of Winter. This
        is the sorcery equivalent of Alluring Skull, but lasts 10 seconds. You
        should have purchased at least 3 copies of the spell prior to starting
        the challenge run.
    -   Amber Herb x 10
    -   Twilight Herb x 5

-   Royal Sorcerer Navlaan. The fastest way to access his shop is to pull a
    nearby lever and free him from his prison. Once freed, Navlaan would invade
    you at various areas in the game. Only free him as the last item on your
    to-do list. The two most useful items he sells are Dragon Charm x 5 and
    Crimson Water x 5. Use Crimson Water to restore a large amount of HP and
    spell uses. Consume a Dragon Charm to cure the poison status ailment. You
    can also use a Poison Moss, but the item cannot be purchased in unlimited
    numbers until you have completed the quest line of Lonesome Gavlan. It is
    not worth your time to initiate and bring Gavlan's quest line to completion.
    The miracle Caressing Prayer can cure poison, but at the cost of 1
    attunement slot.
-   Monastery Charm. Consume to cure poison and restore 850 HP. Three are found
    underneath the Tower of Flame bonfire, at the bottom of a spiral staircase.
-   Radiant Lifegem. Pop to restore 850 HP over the course of 19 seconds. Can
    easily be collected at these locations:

    -   On a platform atop the Shaded Ruins bonfire.
    -   Outside the building where Straid can be found. The item is in a narrow
        alcove guarded by a Royal Swordsman.
    -   Near the Foregarden bonfire of Aldia's Keep. The item is located in the
        water of a fountain.
    -   Near the Undead Crypt Entrance bonfire.
    -   Near the Royal Army Campsite bonfire, in a building containing various
        large jars. You exit the building as you enter upper Brightstone Cove
        Tseldora.
    -   Two are found in a wooden chest atop Belfry Luna, guarded by various
        Bell Keepers and a red phantom Bell Keeper. Summon Masterless Glencour
        to distract some of the Bell Keepers. Grab this item in your quest to
        pull the nearby lever that opens the gate to the arena of the Belfry
        Gargoyles.

-   Amber Herb. The following should be easy to collect.

    -   Two are found at Things Betwixt. Start from the Fire Keepers' Dwelling
        bonfire and continue on the path to Majula. The first fog wall you would
        see is to your left; ignore this fog wall. The second fog wall is to
        your right. Enter the mist and follow the path, at the end of which you
        would find Amber Herb x 2.
    -   One is in an iron chest, behind an illusory wall at Forest of Fallen
        Giants. The treasure is in the trap building near Pate. The chest also
        contains a Sorcerer's Staff.

-   Twilight Herb. The following should be easy to collect.

    -   Two are found in a wooden chest atop Belfry Luna. The chest also
        contains Radiant Lifegem x 2.
    -   One found in a narrow alcove to the left of the entrance to Aldia's
        Keep.

-   Wilted Dusk Herb. The following should be easy to collect.

    -   Three in the cave where Cale is found. The treasure is on a corpse that
        hangs off a ledge, guarded by a Hollow Infantry who wields a bow.
    -   Two in a large pot underneath the Chapel Threshold bonfire, within a
        room guarded by various Parasite Spiders. Outside the room stands a
        Hollow Mage.
    -   Two dropped by a petrified enemy at Aldia's Keep. The enemy stands in
        front of the Giant Basilisk. Unpetrify the enemy, defeat it, and collect
        Wilted Dusk Herb x 2. Burn a Bonfire Ascetic at the Foregarden bonfire
        to respawn the enemy, who is now unpetrified. Defeat it again for
        another Wilted Dusk Herb x 2. Farm the above enemy as many times as
        required.

-   Divine Blessing. The following should be easy to collect.

    -   On a corpse at Majula, encountered on your way to the Far Fire bonfire
        when you sprint from Things Betwixt.
    -   On a tree branch above the Cardinal Tower bonfire. Requires a bit of
        tricky platforming.

-   Brightbug. Eight are found in the game: 2 in the base game and 6 in the
    DLCs. The Brightbug x 6 scattered throughout the 3 DLCs are difficult to
    collect and not worth your time and effort. The Brightbug x 2 in the base
    game are rather easy to collect.

    -   One in an iron chest at Aldia's Keep, on the floor where mirrors hang. A
        number of Looking Glass Phantoms break out of these mirrors.
    -   One from a corpse underneath the Upper Ramparts bonfire, accessible
        after defeating the Belfry Gargoyles.
